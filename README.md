# hello-world
## My first repository

I joined [Alliants](http://www.alliants.com/) after ~~more than~~ *10 years* as an **in-house __Product Owner/Manager__** for various companies, spanning the following industries:

* Publishing
* Online payments
* Ecommerce
* Self-service account management
* Software distribution and online recruitment

The key theme of my time in Product has been a constant drive to do whatever needs to be done to solve problems for businesses and their customers, with the express aim of helping to build forward-looking, scalable businesses that know how to prioritise and structure their product plans to achieve sustainable growth.


Iâ€™m fuelled by the following:

`Sharpies` | The more colourful the better
`Coffee` | It runs through the veins of good product people
