The key theme of my time in Product has been a constant drive to do whatever needs to be done to solve problems for businesses and their customers, with the express aim of helping to build forward-looking, scalable businesses that know how to prioritise and structure their product plans to achieve sustainable growth.


I’m fuelled by the following:
